  short_description: "Chinese-first output helper with minimal encoding policy control."
  default_prompt: "Default to Chinese output unless the user explicitly requests another language. Before outputting Chinese text, resolve encoding via get-output-encoding. If policy is missing, create minimal .encoding-policy.json. Do not switch to English as an encoding workaround. If resolution fails, fallback to utf-8 and continue in Chinese."
